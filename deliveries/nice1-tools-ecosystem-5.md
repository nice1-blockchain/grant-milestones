## Context
The Nice1 Tools Ecosystem project aims to simplify the integration of blockchain technologies within the EOS ecosystem by providing developer-friendly tools for authentication, smart contract interactions, and NFT management.

This milestone focuses on enhancing staking mechanisms and developer tools to facilitate the adoption of Nice1â€™s ecosystem:
- SC Staking â€“ Development of smart contracts for staking both NFTs and Nice1 tokens, allowing users to earn rewards in tokens or NFTs.
- Nice JS Tools â€“ A set of JavaScript/TypeScript tools and React hooks to streamline the integration of Nice1 functionalities into web applications.

This milestone is crucial in expanding the capabilities of Nice1â€™s ecosystem by providing accessible, modular, and scalable solutions that improve the user experience and encourage further adoption of EOS-based decentralized applications.

## Deliverables

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | **SC Staking** Contracts for staking both nfts and nice1 tokens and get tokens or nfts in exchange. |https://github.com/nice1-blockchain/nice1staking| https://github.com/nice1-blockchain/nice1staking/blob/master/readme.md| 
| 2.  | **Nice JS tools** Javascript tools (developed with typescript) and components for easy nice1 integration in websites. |https://github.com/nice1-blockchain/nice-react-tools | The Nice1 JS Tools provide a set of TypeScript-based hooks and utilities to simplify the integration of Nice1 and Anchor Wallet into web applications. Developed components include NFT management (AtomicAssets and SimpleAssets), Anchor Wallet authentication, and blockchain-based user data access for EOSIO. These tools are actively used in the Nice1 Link project and can be seen in action at: https://nice1-link.netlify.app/. ðŸ“Œ Note: Currently, Atomic Assets are not displayed in the demo, but support for them remains available in the library.| 

## Additional Information
- Initially, this deliverable focused on providing basic JavaScript integration tools, but its scope was expanded to include TypeScript and React hooks to ensure greater modularity and scalability.

- Documentation and code structure have been improved to facilitate adoption in third-party projects.
